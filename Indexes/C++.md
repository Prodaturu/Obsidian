# C++

- Main hub for all C++ notes.
- Links to second-level maps: language features, OOP, STL/algorithms, memory, errors, project structure.

---

## 1. Background and big picture

- [[History of C++]]  
    evolution of the language, major standards.
    
- [[C vs C++]]  
    comparison, shared roots, differences.
    
- [[C++ Language Features]]  
    operators, functions, templates, control flow, files, type system.
    
- [[C++ Type System]]  
    built-in types, user-defined types, references, pointers, CV-qualifiers, type deduction.


---

## 2. Object-oriented view

- [[OOPS in C++]]  
    classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation.
    

---

## 3. Working with data and algorithms

- [[C++ Data Structures and Algorithms]]  
    map for containers, algorithms, STL patterns, and custom structures.
    
- [[C++ Libraries]]  
    STL + important external libraries.
    

---

## 4. Memory, errors, and project structure

- [[Memory management in C++]]  
    stack vs heap, allocation, RAII, smart pointers.
    
- [[C++ Error Handling]]  
    exceptions, error codes, assertions.
    
- [[Structuring a C++ codebase|C++ code structuring]]  
    headers, source files, separation, modules, naming rules
