# C++

- Main hub for my C++ notes.
- Links to second-level maps (language features, OOP, STL, algorithms, IO, time).

## 1. background and big picture

- [[History of C++]]  
  where C++ came from, how it evolved, major standards.

- [[C vs C++]]  
  how C and C++ differ, where they overlap, when to use which.

- [[C++ Language Features]]  
  overview of key language features: types, references, RAII, OOP, templates, etc.

---

## 2. object-oriented view

- [[OOPS in C++]]  
  main map for classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and related concepts.

---

## 3. working with data and algorithms

- [[C++ Data Structures and Algorithms]]  
  map for containers, basic data structures, and algorithms in C++ (own code + STL usage).

---

## 4. libraries and ecosystem

- [[C++ Libraries]]  
  standard library overview plus important external libraries and what they are used for.

---

## 5. memory, errors, and project structure

- [[Memory management in C++]]  
  stack vs heap, pointers, references, smart pointers, RAII, and related patterns.

- [[C++ Error Handling]]  
  exceptions, error codes, assertions, and different error handling styles.

- [[C++ Error Handling]] and [[Memory management in C++]] can cross-link if needed,
  but both stay children of this note, not each other.

- [[Structuring a C++ codebase|C++ code structuring]]  
  how to organise headers, source files, modules, and folders for small and large projects.
