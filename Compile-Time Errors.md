# Compile-Time Errors

- **Definition:**
	
- An error that the compiler finds before the program runs
- Stops the build and must be fixed before code can be executed

## Why do compiler-time errors occur?

#### 1. Syntax Errors

- If we broke the **basic rules** of C++.
	- Forgot a semicolon.
	- Forgot a closing brace.
    - Wrote something the compiler cannot read.
    
- Think of it like **bad grammar** in a sentence.

#### 2. Type Mistakes

- Trying to use wrong kind of data
	- Assigning to a number
	- `double` where an `int` was expected
- Think of it like putting a US charger in an European power socket

#### 3. Name Resolution Error
