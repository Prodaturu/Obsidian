# Automata Complexity and Computability - **0.1** 

## Complexity Theory
- Some computer problems are easy, some are hard
- easy -> sorting, scheduling -> much harder
	- 1000 classes makes even a super computer take centuries to find the best solution

*What makes some problems computationally hard and others easy?*
- Central question of complexity theory?
