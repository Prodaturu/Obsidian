# Automata Complexity and Computability - **0.1** 

## Complexity Theory
- Some computer problems are easy, some are hard
- easy -> sorting, scheduling -> much harder
	- 1000 classes makes even a super computer take centuries to find the best solution

*What makes some problems computationally hard and others easy?*
- Central question of complexity theory?
- Several options when you confront a problem that appears to be computationally hard
	1. Understanding which aspect of the problem is at root difficulty, we can alter it to make it more solvable
	2. Settle for less than a perfect solution to the problem
	3. Some problems are only hard in the worst case scenario
