# Const Objects in C++

> Part of Object-related concepts in C++

- A **Const Object** is an object whose state we **cannot modify** after creation

## Basic Idea

```cpp
const Student s;
```
- `s` cannot be changed
- only [[Const Member Functions in C++|const member functions]] can be called
- The compiler enforces these rules

## What "const" really applies to

- `const` applies to the object itself not the class
- Same class can create `const` and `non const` objects
