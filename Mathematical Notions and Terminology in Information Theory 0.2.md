# Mathematical Notions and Terminology in Information Theory - 0.2

## Sets
- Group of objects represented as a unit
- Can contain any type of object, symbols, and even other sets\
- **Member:**  Objects in a set
- **Notation** : {1, 2, 3, 4} - example of a set
- $\in$ -> membership and $\notin$ -> non - membership

### Properties
- The order of describing set elements doesn't matter
- The repetition of a sets members doesn't matter

### Subset
- A is subset of B (**A $\subseteq$ B**) if every member of A is also a member of B

### Proper Subset
- A is a **proper subset** of B (**A $\subsetneq$ B**) if A is a subset of B and is not equal to B
- Example:
	- A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
	- B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
	- $\because$ A is a subset of B (A $\subseteq$ B) and A is not equal to B (A $\neq$ B) => A $\subsetneq$ B

### Multiset
- Sets in which number of occurrences of members is taken into account
- {7} , {7, 7} are different as multisets but same as sets

### Infinite Set
- Has infinitely may elements
- we use the "..." notation to mean -> "continue the sequence forever"
- Example:
	1. Set of 'natural numbers (N)' -> {1, 2, 3, ...}
	2. Set of 'integers (Z)' -> { ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... }

### Empty Set
- A set with no elements / 0 elements is called an **empty set**
- Denoted as $\emptyset$

### Describing a Set
- There are 10 ways or more ways to describe a set
	1. Roster Notation
	2. Set-Builder Notation
	3. Predicate-Only Notation
	4. Interval Notation
	5. Describing with words
	6. Recursive Definition
	7. Definition by construction
	8. Power Set Notation
	9. Cartesian Product Form
	10. Comprehension with Multiple Conditions
- The main three we are concentrated upon 
	1. Roster form (for small finite sets)
	2. Set-builder form
	3. Pattern form (languages)

#### 1. Roster Form
- Used when sets are small and finite
- Examples:
	1. A = {1, 3, 5}
	2. Y = {$q_1$, $q_2$}

#### 2. Set-Builder /Comprehension Notation
- Used mainly for Infinite, rule-based sets
- General Form:
	- {x | condition on x}
	- example: 
		1. {X | X $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$  } 

#### 3. Pattern Form (Languages) / Mathematical Descriptions
- Very common for languages
- { $9^{n}$ | $n$ $>$ $0$ }

### Sequences and Tuples
- List of objects in some order
- Order of objects matters in  a Sequence
- Example: 
	- $\{a, b, c\}$ and $\{c, a , b\}$ are not the same
