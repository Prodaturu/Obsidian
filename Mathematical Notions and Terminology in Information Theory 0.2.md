# Mathematical Notions and Terminology in Information Theory - 0.2

## Sets
- Group of objects represented as a unit
- Can contain any type of object, symbols, and even other sets\
- **Member:**  Objects in a set
- **Notation** : {1, 2, 3, 4} - example of a set
- $\in$ -> membership and $\notin$ -> non - membership

### Properties
- The order of describing set elements doesn't matter
- The repetition of a sets members doesn't matter

### Subset
- A is subset of B (**A $\subseteq$ B**) if every member of A is also a member of B

### Proper Subset
- A is a **proper subset** of B (**A $\subsetneq$ B**) if A is a subset of B and is not equal to B
- Example:
	- A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
	- B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
	- $\because$ A is a subset of B (A $\subseteq$ B) and A is not equal to B (A $\neq$ B) => A $\subsetneq$ B

### Multiset
- Sets in which number of occurrences of members is taken into account
- {7} , {7, 7} are different as multisets but same as sets

### Infinite Set
- Has infinitely may elements
- we use the "..." notation to mean -> "continue the sequence forever"
- Example:
	1. Set of 'natural numbers (N)' -> {1, 2, 3, ...}
	2. Set of 'integers (Z)' -> { ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... }

### Empty Set
- A set with no elements / 0 elements is called an **empty set**
- Denoted as $\emptyset$
