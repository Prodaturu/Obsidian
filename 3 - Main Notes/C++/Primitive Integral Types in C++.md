# Primitive Integral Types in C++

> Part of C++ data types.

Primitive integral types represent whole numbers and simple boolean values.
They differ mainly in **size** and whether they are **signed** or **unsigned**.

## List of primitive integral types

- `bool` – logical true/false  
- `char` – typically a small integer used for characters  
- `signed char` – small signed integer  
- `unsigned char` – small unsigned integer  
- `short`, `unsigned short` – small integers  
- `int`, `unsigned int` – “default” integer size for the platform  
- `long`, `unsigned long` – larger integers  
- `long long`, `unsigned long long` – guaranteed at least 64 bits

## Key ideas

- **Signed vs unsigned**  
	- Signed: can store negative and positive values.  
	- Unsigned: only non-negative, but larger max value in same number of bits.
	  
- **Overflow**  
	- Behaviour of signed overflow is undefined.  
	- Unsigned overflow wraps modulo $2^n$.
	  
- **Type choice**  
	- `int` for most general counting.  
	- `size_t` (see fixed-width note) for sizes and indexes.  
	- wider types only when we really need them.
