# Control Flow in C++

> How C++ decides **what runs next**.

Control flow is about:

- choosing between paths (branches)
- repeating actions (loops)
- exiting a block or function early (jumps / return)

## Branching

- [[If else in C++]]  
  Basic conditional logic.

- [[Switch Statements in C++]]  
  Multi-way branching based on an integral / enum / constant expression.


## Loops

- [[Loops in C++]] 
	- Overview: `for`, `while`, `do-while`.
	
- [[Range Based For Loop in C++]]  
	- Container-friendly loop syntax (`for (auto x : container)`)  {syntax (C++11+)}
	  
- [[Break and Continue in C++]] 
	- Controlling how loops proceed or stop


## Jumps and function exit

- [[Return Statement in C++]]  
	- Exit a function and (optionally) return a value.

- [[goto and Labels in C++]]  
	- Rarely used, but part of the control flow toolbox.
