# Control Flow in C++

> How C++ decides **what runs next**.

Control flow is about:

- making decisions (branches)
- repeating work (loops)
- leaving a block or function early (jumps and return)

---

## Branching

- [[If and Else in C++]]  
  Basic conditional logic.

- [[Switch Statements in C++]]  
  Multi-way branch based on an integral / enum / constant expression.

---

## Loops

- [[Loops in C++]]  
  Overview: `for`, `while`, `do-while`.

- [[Range Based For Loop in C++]]  
  Cleaner `for (auto x : container)` syntax (C++11+).

- [[Break and Continue in C++]]  
  Controlling loop execution.

---

## Jumps and function exit

- [[Return Statement in C++]]  
  Leaving a function and (optionally) returning a value.

- [[Goto and Labels in C++]]  
  Rarely used, but part of the control flow toolbox.
