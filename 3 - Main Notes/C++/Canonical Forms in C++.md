# Canonical Forms in C++

> How to give a class a clear, well defined lifetime in C++.

- “Canonical form” answers:
	
	- how is this class **constructed**?
	- how is this class **copied** or **moved**?
	- how is this class **destroyed**?
	
- Different eras of C++ favour different canonical shapes.

## Main variants

- [[Orthodox Canonical Form in C++]]  
	- C++98 style: default ctor, copy ctor, copy assignment, destructor.

- [[Modern Canonical Forms in C++]]  
	- C++11 and later:
	- resource owning form (rule of five)
	- rule of zero form (no special members).
