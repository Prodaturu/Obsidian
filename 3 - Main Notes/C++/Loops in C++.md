# Loops in C++

> part of C++ control flow.

- loops let you repeat work until a condition is met or a sequence is finished
- C++ main loop types:
	- [[for loops in C++]]  
		- counter-based or sequence-based iteration
		  
	- [[while loops in C++]]  
		- repeat while a condition stays true
		  
	- [[do-while loops in C++]]  
		- run the body at least once, then check the condition
	 
- loop control helpers:
	- [[Break and Continue in C++]]  
		- exit early or skip an iteration
