## Definitions, Theorems, and proofs

### Definitions

- Describe the objects and notions that we use
- A definition may be simple (*set*) or complex (*security*) in a cryptographic system
- Precision is essential to any mathematical definition
- Must be made clear what constitutes that object and what doesn't

### Mathematical Statements: 

- Usually expresses some object has a certain property
- Statement may or may not be true
	- but, like a decision it must be precise
	- There must not be any ambiguity about it's meaning

### Proof

- Convincing logical argument that a statement is true
- proof beyond any doubt is must

### Theorem

- Mathematical statement proved to be true
	- Generally reserved for statements of special interest
	  
- Sometimes we prove statements only because they assist in proof of another, more significant statement
	- Such proofs are called **lemmas**
	  
- A theorem or its proof may allow us to conclude that other, related statements are true
	- Such statements are called as **Corollaries** of the theorem


## Finding Proofs
%% page 17 (37) %%
- Only way to determine truth or falsity of a statement is through mathematical proof

- **General strategies:**
	-  Carefully read the statement to prove
	- Understand the notation
		- Rewrite in own words
	- Break it down and consider each part separately
	
	- Sometimes part of multipart statement are not immediately evident
