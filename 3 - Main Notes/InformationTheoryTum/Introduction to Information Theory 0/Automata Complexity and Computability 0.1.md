# Automata Complexity and Computability - **0.1** 

## Complexity Theory
- **Definition:** Classify problems based on difficulty
- Some computer problems are easy, some are hard
- easy -> sorting, scheduling -> much harder
	- 1000 classes makes even a super computer take centuries to find the best solution

*What makes some problems computationally hard and others easy?*
- Central question of complexity theory?
- Several options when you confront a problem that appears to be computationally hard
	1. Understanding which aspect of the problem is at root difficulty, we can alter it to make it more solvable
	2. Settle for less than a perfect solution to the problem
	3. Some problems are only hard in the worst case scenario

- Cryptography is an area that is directly affected by this area
- Unlike most fields cryptography needs computationally hard problems as the because secret codes / keys should be hard to break without the secret key or the password
- Complexity theory has pointed cryptographers towards hard problems around which they designed revolutionary new codes

## Computability Theory
- **Definition:** Classification if a problem is solvable or not by a computer
- Kurt Godel, Alan Turing, Alonzo Church discovered that certain basic problems cant be solved by computers
- True or False mathematical statements are an example for problems that computers are bad at solving
- Led to development of theoretical models of computers that would eventually help lead to actual computers

## Automata Theory
- Deals with definitions and properties of mathematical models of computation
	- *finite momentum* - Text processing
	- *context-free grammar* - programming languages and AI
- Excellent place to start studying theory of computation
