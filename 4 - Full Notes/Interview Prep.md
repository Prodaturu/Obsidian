# Interview Prep

## General Questions

- Lead and mentored a technical team
- Set development road-maps and oversaw agile processes
- Handled end-to-end product development

#### Question 1 Gen

- **How did you approach performance optimisation in your projects?**
	
- "I took a systematic approach"
- starting with front-end, I used React optimisation techniques like memorisation and code splitting
- For Back-end, I focused on database query optimisation through proper indexing and implemented caching strategies
- At Cyberin Systems, this reduced times by 20% and improved data access speed by 25%


#### Question 2 Gen

- **Describe your leadership style as a CTO**
	
- My leadership approach balances technical guidance with team empeworment
	
- At Yesalwa, I set the technical vision and architecture while mentoring engineers to grow their skills
	
- I implemented agile processes with 2 week sprints,
	- ensuring we maintained momentum while delivering quality
	  
- I believe in leading by example
	- Being hand-on with both the AI development and React Native application
	- while guiding the team's overall direction


#### Question 3 Gen

- **How do you mentor and develop technical talent?**
	
- I focus on practical growth through code reviews and pair programming
	- and gradually increasing responsibility
- At Yesalwa, I worked closely with each engineer, understanding their strengths and career goals
- I also conducted regular technical discussions to share knowledge about
	- our AI architecture and system design
	- which helped the team understand the bigger picture, beyond their immediate tasks


#### Question 4 Gen

- **How do you handle project planning in general?**
	
- I break down complex projects into manageable sprints with clear deliverables
- At Yesalwa, I created a development roadmap that balanced feature development with technical debt
- We use agile methodologies with regular stand ups and retrospectives
	- which helped us adapt quickly while maintaining transparency about progress and challenges



## AI

#### Question 1 AI

- **Tell me about your experience with AI model development**
	
- As CTO at Yesalwa, I led the development of our core AI model
	- that analysed user behaviour patterns
	- to understand personality types
- Starting from research,
	- I designed model architecture using TensorFlow, focusing on classifying user interactions into meaningful personality segments
	- This AI became the intellectual property that powered our personalised fashion recommendation engine
	- creating a unique User Experience


#### Question 2 AI

- **How did you approach the behavioural pattern analysis**
	
- I treated it as a classification problem
	- We tracked user interactions like session duration, scroll behaviour, and preference selections
	- Then transformed this raw data into feature vectors
	  
- Started with a **Random Forest** model for its interpretability with smaller datasets
	- with a road-map to transition to neural networks as our data grew
	
- The output was a personality profile that drove our recommendation algorithms


#### Question 3 AI

- **What was the business impact of the AI work?**
	
- The AI model directly enabled our personalised recommendation engine
	- Which was our key competitive advantage
	
- It transformed generic fashion browsing into a tailored experience
	- Increasing user engagement and addressing specific customer needs through data-driven insights


#### Question 4 AI

- 


## AWS

#### Question 1 AWS

- **Explain your experience with cloud platforms like AWS**
	
- I have hands on experience with **AWS EC2** for development and **RDS** for managed database services
- At Yesalwa, we containerized our application with Docker and deployed on EC2, which gave us flexibility in scaling
- For database, RDS provided built-in backups and monitoring, allowing us to focus on application logic rather than infrastructure management


## DevOps

#### Question 1 DevOps

- **Whats your experience with DevOps tools**
	
- I have used **Git** for version control across multiple projects
- Docker for containerisation, and implemented CI/CD pipelines
- At Ciberin, I managed Git repos for 3 projects, reducing merge conflicts through better branching strategies and team coordination- 

#### Question 2 DevOps
