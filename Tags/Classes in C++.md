# Classes in C++

> core building block of object-oriented programming in C++.

- this note is a **hub** for understanding how classes are defined, structured, and extended in C++.

## What is a class?

- a **user-defined type**
- acts as a **blueprint**
- groups:
	- data (data members)
	- behaviour (member functions)
- A class itself does **not** allocate memory.

## Core parts of a class

- data members (state)
- member functions (behaviour)
- access control
- constructors & destructors

each of these is explained in its own note.
