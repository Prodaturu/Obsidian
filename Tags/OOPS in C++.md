# OOPS in C++

> object-oriented programming concepts as implemented in C++.

- **hub** for core OOP ideas.  
- each linked note focuses on **one concept only**.

## Core OOP concepts

- [[Classes in C++]]  
  how data and behaviour are grouped together.

- [[Encapsulation in C++]]  
  controlling access to data using public / private / protected.

- [[Inheritance in C++]]  
  creating new classes based on existing ones.

- [[Polymorphism in C++]]  
  treating related objects uniformly using base-class interfaces.

## Navigation

- parent: C++  
- children: the four core OOP concepts above  
- deeper details (constructors, virtual functions, abstract classes, etc.) live under those child notes.
