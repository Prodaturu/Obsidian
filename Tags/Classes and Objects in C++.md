# Classes and Objects in C++

> core building block of object-oriented programming in C++.

- this note is a **hub** for understanding how data and behavior are modeled using classes and objects.


## What is a class?

- a **user-defined type**
- acts as a **blueprint**
- groups:
  - data (data members)
  - behavior (member functions)

a class itself does **not** allocate memory.

---

## What is an object?

- an **instance** of a class
- memory is allocated when an object is created
- each object has its **own copy** of data members

---

## Core parts of a class

- data members (state)
- member functions (behavior)
- access control
- constructors & destructors

each of these is explained in its own note.
